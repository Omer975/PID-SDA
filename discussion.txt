...accessing an element (get operation)?

Accessing an element for a linkedlist has a disadvantage compared to an array list. 
Because it takes longer to find the element and access it. 
This is because the address of the element to be retrieved will be found.

...adding an element?

Adding a linked list element is more advantageous than adding an element to an array list. 
Because when the array list element is added, all the elements after the index added have to shift to the right. 
This situation causes serious waste of time. In this case, it may cause serious loss of time and cost for very large lists. But for the linkedlist, 
an element is added in between and only the addresses shown by the relevant node links change without changing the location of any other element.

...removing an element?

Removing a linked list element is more advantageous than removing an element to an array list. 
Because when the array list element is removed, In case of deleting an element in arraylist, 
all elements to the right of the deleted element have to shift to the left instead of the deleted element. 
This situation causes serious time and cost loss.
In this case, it may cause serious loss of time and cost for very large lists. But for the linkedlist, 
an element is removed in between and only the addresses shown by the relevant node links change without changing the location of any other element.

...memory usage?

in memory usage, it is more advantageous arraylist than linkedlist. 
Linkedlist takes up more space in memory because it holds both the address and the related value.
but the arraylist only has one address. There will be a place for related values ​​inside.
